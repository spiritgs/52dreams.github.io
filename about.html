<p>The time you got up early, the time you worked hard, the time you stayed up late, the time you spent studying hard, the time when you felt you were not working hard and feeling too tired, those you do not want to persecute yourself, but still choose to continue to do that time, that is to pursue the meaning of the dream.</p>
